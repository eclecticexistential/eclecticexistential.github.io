# Eclectic Existential's Portfolio Website

Website created with Bootstrap as well as Flexbox to showcase CSS, jQuery, Javascript, and Ajax projects created by me.    
The purpose of this website is to provide potential employers with a way to gauge my programming skills.     

## __Python__  
Various Python related projects developed by me. Highlights include a Django/Heroku app, Magic The Gathering Simulation, and Data Science projects
including but not limited to Data Visualization graphs.

## __Javascript__  
Mini projects include a Body Mass Index calculator that works for metric and standard measurement types and a color picker that generates hues based on rgb values.  
Main project is a Play 21, aka BlackJack, game. Cards are generated with random suits and numbers. Game follows standard Play21 game, minus the split option.

## __AJAX__  
Three seperate API calls can be located in the AJAX area.  

### Weather App   
Enter the city you live in for current weather information. Images, made with CSS, change according to weather conditions.
Temperature can even be toggled between Celsius and Fahrenheit with a built-in algorithm.

### Nutrition App  
Powered by Nutritionx, this APP is designed to tell you the calories per serving of anything you are craving.    (Including restaurant items.)

### NASA APOD   
I dedicated a page to NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day. The landing page features a looped GIF of the nightsky as it rotates throughout the night.   
To reduce the time it takes for the webpage to load, I included a 'beforeSend' feature, that let's the user know that the content is being loaded.   

Let me know what you think!
